# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up some css on portfolio site, created repo on Github.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty happy with the layout thus far, really it's just a landing page with links to my github, twitter and Medium, but at least it looks good ;-)
