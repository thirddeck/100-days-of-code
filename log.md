# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up some css, created repo on Github.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
